# Knight-Rider-Arduino

Description

Simple application designed with an Arduino Mega board ,8 LEDs, and a potentiometer used to switch between 3 functioning modes. First animation represents the Knight Rider movement, the second one is just a simple PWM (Pulse width modulation) application and the third one is just using repetitive functions to play with the LEDs. 

Installation
- take the code and put it into a IDE that supports Arduino development
- you will need 8 LEDs, 8 resistors, 1 pot, arduino mega(uno is fine too, but you have less pins for PWM), breadboard and wires
- connect first pin of the pot to GND, the middle one to analog input and the last one to 5V
- connect the LEDs to the breadboard and then into the pins you want(i used pins 2-9)
- the value you input to the circuit from the pot, will be used to select the animation you want to see
- enjoy!
